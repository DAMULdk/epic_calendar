# Epic Calendar
 
**Calendar app with notifications**

My app contains a calendar and it's base function is manageing events.

#### Reminders
reminders are features that let you view reminders a few days prior. If you have for example 3 reminders, you will see reminder 3 days before, 2 days before and a day before the event.
## Usage
**To make events display on the screen you have to put *notifications.pyw* into autostart or run it manually everytime when you run your computer.**

Use *main.py* or *main.pyw* to create, see or delete your events.

files *events.json* adn *options.txt* should create automatically.
## Remarks
After moving epic_calendar folder to other locations you should restart the *notifications.pyw* in case of location error.

This app works on Windows and im not sure if it works on Linux and Mac as well.

Editing the code can cause errors.

This app was made for a school project and it may have flaws.

If something isn't working contact me.

Fell free to use code and app however you want.
## Files
*mian.py* - console calendar managment ui  
*main.pyw* - graphical calendar managment ui  
*notifications.pyw* - events listener  
*system.py* - mian app logic

*options.txt* - user's options and info (created automatically)  
*events.json* - events info (created automatically)  
## Functions
This app contains many functions, each of them should have documentation.

I have added validation functions from my other project, they are universal functions:  
- `is_valid(...)`
- `validator(...)`
- `adv_dt_validator(...)`
